# HireMe! - The Job Search Engine

Hire Me! is a Job Search Engine to demonstrate my skill in PHP Laravel.

This project was accomplished in a week and was my first contact with this framework. It follows all good community conventions and best practices. I tried to use as many Laravel features as I could, including all the security-related functions. You can find a list in the Laravel Features section.
